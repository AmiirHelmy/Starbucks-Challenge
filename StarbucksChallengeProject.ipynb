    "This dataset contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data has transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer.

    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caution\n",
    "A user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",

    "- Offers 7 and 6 have the highest completion counts, so Starbucks should send these offers more frequently.\n",
    "- Users are only influenced by 'discount' and 'BOGO' offers, so Starbucks should focus more on those.\n",
    "- All age groups prefer discounts offers in comparison to other offer types, hence, Starbucks should send more discounts offers.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this project, I tried to analyze the data and make a model to determine which users should Starbucks send offers to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First I explored the data and did some data wrangling to help my analysis, then I did some exploratory analysis on the data after cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the company should give more offers to Males since they have more completed offers. And they should focus on Discount offers since they are the most common types."
